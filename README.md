This game is similar to Flappy Bird in that there are obstacles to avoid by jumping/falling.
If you select a premade difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard), the obstacle speeds will gradually increase until 1 minute passes and you win.
Please keep track of your energy level and time left on the left hand side of the screen.
If you energy reaches 0, you will lose.

Please run the 'main.py' file for this game.
This game also uses the 'cmu_graphics' library.
